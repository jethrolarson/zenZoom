Zen Zoom
========

Really simple picture zoom plugin.

Usage
-------

1. Include zenzoom.js and zenzoom.css
2. Add class="zoom" to links you want to zoom. Links should point to the fullsize version.
3. Change "projects/zenzoom/" to match the path from the page to the zenzoom directory (for IE)

TODO
----
* Remove step 3 above. Add the cursor via script maybe?
* Make the margins of large images calculated based on the CSS.
